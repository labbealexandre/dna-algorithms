\section{Maximum degree of $3\Delta_{avg} + 8$}

Maciek: Intro to the algorithm, comparison with DISC algorithm.
(high degree nodes participate as helpers, H-H edges are replaced, low degree nodes are $n/4$ of all nodes)

\subsection{Algorithm}


The algorithm arbitrarily assigns a node to \emph{help} each edge in the demand graph.
While doing so, it ensures that each node helps at most $\beta = \lceil\Delta_{avg}/2\rceil$ edges.


To construct the network, we first construct an \emph{auxiliary graph} $G'$ that is initially equal to the demand distribution graph $G_D$.
Then, we construct the network $N$ from $G'$.

Now we construct the auxiliary graph $G'$ based upon the helper nodes assignment.
If the helping node $k$ is chosen as either $i$ or $j$, then do not modify any edges of $G'$.
Otherwise, if the algorithm helps $k \neq i,j$ to help the edge $(i, j)$, we replace the edge $(i, j)$ in $G'$ with 
2-hop paths through $k$:
$$ p(i,j) = 0$$
$$ p(i,k) = p(i,k) + p(i,j)$$
$$ p(k,j) = p(k,j) + p(i,j)$$
We say that the edges $(i,k)$ and $(k,j)$ added to (and from) intermediate nodes are \emph{intermediate edges}.

Next, we construct the network $N$ based upon the auxiliary graph $G'$.
We start with an empty network $N$.
In $G'$, a node $i$ has two types of new neighbors: 
the set $G_i$ of intermediate nodes that replaced an initial edges of $i$, and the set $H_i$ of nodes in whose edges $i$ is helping.
Among $G_i$ we distinguish the set $G_i^-$ (resp. $G_i^+$) of nodes that are connected with $i$ with an ingoing (resp. outgoing) edges.
For each node $i$, the algorithm constructs two Mehlhorn trees in $N$, one for $G_i^-$ and another for $G_i^+$, and connects its roots to $i$.
(reference to Figure of i,j and helper k)

Note that we skip the set $H_i$ while building the Mehlhorn trees of neighbors of $i$.
However, the connection (possibly indirect) between $i$ and a node $j \in H_i$ appears while building the Mehlhorn tree of $j$.

\medskip

Now we claim that the algorithm has a sufficient number of nodes available as helpers 
 (i.e., the total number of available helpers $n \cdot \beta$ is sufficient to help all $m$ edges).

  $$n \cdot \beta = \frac{n\Delta_{avg}}{2} = m$$

and we conclude that the algorithm is well-defined.

\medskip
\newpage
Now, we upper-bound the maximal final degree of the nodes.
A node $i$ is involved in one Mehlhorn tree
for each node it helped, in total at most $2\beta$ trees.
Furthermore, the node $i$ is connected with one edge to Mehlhorn trees $G_i^+$ and $G_i^-$.
Note that the node $i$ is not involved in the Mehlhorn trees of the intermediate nodes
that replaced a node between $i$ and another node.
%The degree of each node may increase beyond its initial degree because it helps other nodes, and, more importantly, because it may participate in Mehlhorn trees of its neighbors.
A~participation in each Mehlhorn tree adds at most $3$ edges to a node, thus its final degree $\gamma_i$ is

$$\gamma_i \leq 6\beta + 2 \leq 6 \left(\frac{\Delta_{avg}}{2}+1\right) + 2 =  3\Delta_{avg} + 8.$$
%
We conclude that the algorithm produces a network
with maximum degree of $3\Delta_{avg} + 8$.

Remarks.
When a node is assigned to help one of its incident edges, it is the most efficient.
However, the analysis holds for arbitrary assignments.

In this example, $\Delta_{avg} = 1$ thus the limit of the number of times a node can help
is $\lceil\Delta_{avg}/2\rceil = 1$. 
Nodes $1$ and $3$ help the edges $(4,2)$ and $(2,1)$, respectively.
For each node $i$, a Mehlhorn tree is built on the set of nodes that
helped an edge connected to $i$.
The initial degree of $3$ is $0$, thus there is no Mehlhorn tree from it.
The nodes $1$ and $3$ help the only edge of $4$ and $1$, respectively.
The built Mehlhorn trees are simple edges.
Finally, $2$ is connected to an outgoing and an ingoing edge, thus two
Mehlhorn trees including the nodes $1$ and $3$, will be built from $2$.


Now we claim that EPL are within the constant in comparison to optimum.
This is a consequence of near-optimality of Mehlhorn trees.

\section{Dealing with congestion}

Above algorithm has asymptotically optimal congestion.
The lower bound from INFOCOM paper, let's say it's $c$ on the most loaded edge of EgoTree.
Then, our most congested edge is the one connecting the root to the Mehlhorn tree, and it has congestion $c \cdot \Delta_{avg}$.

Introduce p-EgoTree and the new way of constructing them (instead of solving the scheduling, we simulate solving it, and then pack some trees together).
Show its properties: it approximates congestion.

Now we show how to trade the congestion to the increased $\Delta_{max}$.
Using $p$-EgoTrees gives us the $\Delta_{max} = 3\cdot \Delta_{avg} + 6 ) 2 \cdot p \cdot \Delta_{avg}$.
The congestion is then $4/3$ of LPTF, multiplied by $\Delta_{max} / (p \cdot \Delta_{avg})$.
The final congestion bound is due to the number of times the node can help, $\beta_i$.
