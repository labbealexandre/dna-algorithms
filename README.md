# dna-algorithms

### Requirements

You need python3 and the following packages:
- unittest
- networkx
- matloplib
- tqdm

### Use

To be sure that the algorithms work successfully on your machine you can run tests.
```
python3 -m unittest discover
```

You can launch an existing script in the toplevel folder or create your own. We have to run it from the root of the project.
```
python3 -m toplevel.circulant
```

circulant.py is a simple script you can use as an example to code your own toplevel script.
